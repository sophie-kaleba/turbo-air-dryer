naive js JIT compiler developped together with @irevoire in a courses at [Lille1](http://fil.univ-lille1.fr/) given by [Gilles Grimaud](http://www.lifl.fr/~grimaud/) and [Samuel Hym](http://www.lifl.fr/~hym/).
Will undergo some heavy refactoring in the future

# USAGE

In order to do anything with this Jit / Interpreter you'll need to parse your file.

Because this project was a college project at first we didn't code our own lexer / parser and used the one provided in our course : __jsp__

```
git clone http://www.fil.univ-lille1.fr/~hym/d/jsp.git
```
